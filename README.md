## Overview
This is the full script for a time-based quiz on HTML and Javascript. The main menu is loaded up right away, giving the player the directions and offering the start quiz button. Once it's pushed, a question and several multiple choice answers appear, and the timer begins to countdown. After several questions, the User is asked to input their initials, or go back to the main menu.

## Installation
This HTML file requires a .CSS style sheet and .js file for javascript functionality. By placing the entire website folder on a server together, it can be uploaded to a server, and the files can be found.

## Features
Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, window prompts ask the user to input how many characters long their password should be. If a number between 8 and 128 is not input, it will prompt the user again.

Next, prompts appear asking the users whether they would like to include numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and then special characters in their password.

Finally, the program displays the password for the user to see and copy.
