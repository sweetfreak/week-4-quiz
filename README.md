## Overview
This is the full script for a time-based quiz on HTML and Javascript. The main menu is loaded up right away, giving the player the directions and offering the start quiz button. Once it's pushed, a question and several multiple choice answers appear, and the timer begins to countdown. After several questions, the User is asked to input their initials, or go back to the main menu. If they input their initials, they'll be brought tot he high scores page.

## Installation
This HTML file requires a .CSS style sheet and .js file for javascript functionality. By placing the entire website folder on a server together, it can be uploaded to a server, and the files can be found.

## Features
This quiz features 3 questions. The timer starts at 100 seconds, but the player loses 20 seconds for each incorrect answer. If time runs out, or all the questions are answered, the player is brought to the high score screen, where they can enter their initials, or go back to the main menu. If they submit their initials, they'll see a list of other scores, retrieved from the local storage.
